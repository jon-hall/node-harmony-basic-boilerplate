node harmony basic boilerplate
-
A very simple boilerplate for node harmony projects.  Get it using:
> `npm install node-harmony-basic-boilerplate`

Answer the prompt questions and it'll do the rest - copying the resulting project back into the directory you ran `npm install` in.

NOTE: There are currently a couple of sketchy bits of code to get gulp/jasmine/harmony all playing nice - as soon as I figure out better fixes I'll patch.  Also, the install will currently only work properly on *Windows* - looking to address this as soon as I can.
