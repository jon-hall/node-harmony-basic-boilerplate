node harmony basic boilerplate
-
A very simple boilerplate for node harmony projects.

### Install
```sh
$ npm install node-harmony-basic-boilerplate
```

Answer the prompt questions and it'll do the rest - copying the resulting project back into the directory you ran `npm install` in.

**NOTE:** There are currently a couple of sketchy bits of code to get gulp/jasmine/harmony all playing nice - fixes incoming as soon as a better solution is conceived.  Also, the install will currently only work properly on **Windows** - looking to address this as soon as possible.
